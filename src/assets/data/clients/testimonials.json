        "description": "Marni worked for me on a project where we were modernizing a legacy application. As this was one of the core applications our client used it had complex business rules and a spaghetti code base. Marni was able to pick up the knowledge of the business and application within 2 weeks and was able to make sound architectural recommendations to help prolong the life of the application. The client manager and team were very appreciate of Marniâ€™s capabilities and recommendation. In addition to his technical strengths, Marni has excellent communication skills and is always proactively discussing issues and bringing solutions to mitigate them to leadership. I definitely recommend Marni as he is a valuable asset to any organization."

        "description": "Marny is not only a pleasure to work with, but his technical capabilities and work ethic are stellar. I also appreciate that when something unforeseen comes up, Marny is quick to research and come up with a solution (or options) versus waiting for direction. Working with him via a near-shore model, Marny communicates very frequently making it seem less like he is just down the road working remotely!"
